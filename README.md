## <a name="Project">Project Direction</a>
I created this app to improve my understanding of testing with jest and enzyme, components and API's. Although I ran into a few problems making this app I learned alot including shallow tesing with enzyme, state management and API usage.

## <a name="user-stories">User Stories</a>

```
As a user of Video Player.
I expect to see a search bar, where I can input a term to search for the type of videos I want to watch.
```

```
As a user of Video Player.
When I enter a search term into the search bar and hit enter,
I expect to the loading... message to disappear and the app to rerender.
```

```
As a user of Video Player. 
When I enter a search term into the search bar and hit enter,
I expect the app to rerender with a selection of videos relevent to my search term.
```

```
As a user of Video Player. 
When I've searched for the video I want to watch,
I expect to be able to click the video and my video to begin playing.
